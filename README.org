* mito-auth-jzon

This library basically brings together mito-auth and jzon-util to avoid json encoding the password slots from =has-secure-password=.
* Getting The Code

The code currently lives in [[https://github.com/daninus14/mito-auth-jzon][GitHub]]

* Basic Usage

Here's a simple example

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
  CL-USER> (defclass user1 (mito-auth:has-secure-sensitive-password)
    ((name :col-type (:varchar 60)
           :initarg :name
           :accessor user-name)
     (email :col-type (:varchar 255)
            :initarg :email
            :accessor user-email)
     (secret :col-type (or :null :text)
             :accessor secret
             :sensitive t))
    (:metaclass mito-auth-jzon:mito-auth-jzon-metaclass))
  #<MITO-AUTH-JZON:MITO-AUTH-JZON-METACLASS COMMON-LISP-USER::USER1>
  CL-USER> (make-instance 'user1 :name "robert" :email "robert@ludlum.com" :password "bourne" :secret "jason")
  #<USER1 {1004743603}>
  CL-USER> (inspect *)

  The object is a STANDARD-OBJECT of type USER1.
  0. PASSWORD-HASH: "eb9589da31ec4d09d43879ebc106d55fab3db1321e1980e3c445a6b02a2b85aa"
  1. PASSWORD-SALT: #(184 252 253 13 101 200 240 24 44 116 95 210 250 251 28 24
                      197 80 191 137)
  2. NAME: "robert"
  3. EMAIL: "robert@ludlum.com"
  4. SECRET: "jason"
  > q
  ; No values
  CL-USER> (com.inuoe.jzon:stringify (make-instance 'user1 :name "robert" :email "robert@ludlum.com" :password "bourne" :secret "jason"))
  "{\"name\":\"robert\",\"email\":\"robert@ludlum.com\"}"
#+END_SRC

As you can see, the password related fields are not encoded.

They key ideas to keep in mind is that
1. We need to set the metaclass to be =mito-auth-jzon:mito-auth-jzon-metaclass=
2. Mark any slot you don't want to be displayed with =:sensitive t=

* Manual

For the usage of the authentication, please referer to the original project [[https://github.com/fukamachi/mito-auth][mito-auth]].

For detailed usage of the =sensitve= to avoid json encoding API see [[https://github.com/daninus14/jzon-util][jzon-util]].

To use define a class and inherit from =mito-auth:has-secure-sensitive-password= and apply the metaclass =mito-auth-jzon:mito-auth-jzon-metaclass=. See above for an example.
